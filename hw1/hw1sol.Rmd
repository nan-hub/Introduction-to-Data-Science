## Q1. Git/GitHub

**No handwritten homework reports are accepted for this course.** We work with Git and GitHub. Efficient and abundant use of Git, e.g., frequent and well-documented commits, is an important criterion for grading your homework.

1. Apply for the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) at GitHub using your UCLA email.


2. Create a **private** repository `biostat-203b-2020-winter` and add `Hua-Zhou` and `juhkim111` as your collaborators with write permission.


3. Top directories of the repository should be `hw1`, `hw2`, ... Maintain two branches `master` and `develop`. The `develop` branch will be your main playground, the place where you develop solution (code) to homework problems and write up report. The `master` branch will be your presentation area. Submit your homework files (R markdown file `Rmd`, `html` file converted from R markdown, all code and data sets to reproduce results) in `master` branch.


4. After each homework due date, teaching assistant and instructor will check out your master branch for grading. Tag each of your homework submissions with tag names `hw1`, `hw2`, ... Tagging time will be used as your submission time. That means if you tag your `hw1` submission after deadline, penalty points will be deducted for late submission.

**Solution:**I have created this repository, wihch you are reading now.


## Q2. Linux Shell Commands

1. This exercise (and later in this course) uses the [MIMIC-III data](https://mimic.physionet.org), a freely accessible critical care database developed by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology. Please follow the instructions at <https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/> to complete the CITI `Data or Specimens Only Research` course. Show the screenshot of your completion report. 

**Solution:** Here is a screenshot of my completion report.

</p>


2. The `/home/203bdata/mimic-iii/` folder on teaching server contains data sets from MIMIC-III. See <https://mimic.physionet.org/mimictables/admissions/> for details of each table.  
    ```{bash}
    ls -l /home/203bdata/mimic-iii
    ```
Please, do **not** put these data files into Git; they are big. Also do **not** copy them into your directory. Just read from the data folder `/home/203bdata/mimic-iii` directly in following exercises. 

    Use Bash commands to answer following questions.

3. What's the output of following bash script?
```{bash echo=TRUE}
    for datafile in /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/*.csv
      do
        ls $datafile
      done
    ```

**Solution**:

The output is the file end up with "csv" in the folder called mimic-iii, whose path is /home/203bdata/mimic-iii.
Also means all the csv file in the folder /home/203bdata/mimic-iii.

Display the number of lines in each `csv` file.


**Solution:**


```{bash echo=TRUE}
for datafile in /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/*.csv
  do
   wc -l $datafile
  done
```


4. -Display the first few lines of `ADMISSIONS.csv`.


**Solution:** Let's display the first 10 lines of `ADMISSIONS.csv`
```{bash echo=TRUE}
   head /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/ADMISSIONS.csv 
```


-How many rows are in this data file?


**Solution:**
```{bash echo=TRUE}
awk 'END { print NR }' /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/ADMISSIONS.csv
```
There are 58977 rows in ADMISSIONS.csv datafile.

-How many unique patients (identified by `SUBJECT_ID`) are in this data file?


**Solution:**
```{bash echo=TRUE}
awk -F, '{print $2}' /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/ADMISSIONS.csv | sed -n '2,$p' | sort | uniq | wc -l
```
There are 46520 unique patients in this data file.


-What are the possible values taken by each of the variable `INSURANCE`, `LANGUAGE`, `RELIGION`, `MARITAL_STATUS`, and `ETHNICITY`?


**Solution:**

*INSURANCE*
```{bash echo=TRUE}
awk -F, '{print $10}' /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/ADMISSIONS.csv | sed -n '2,$p' | sort | uniq
```

*LANGUAGE*
```{bash}
awk -F, '{print $11}' /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/ADMISSIONS.csv | sed -n '2,$p' | sort | uniq
```

*RELIGION*
```{bash}
awk -F, '{print $12}' /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/ADMISSIONS.csv | sed -n '2,$p' | sort | uniq
```

*MARITAL_STATUS*
```{bash}
awk -F, '{print $13}' /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/ADMISSIONS.csv | sed -n '2,$p' | sort | uniq
```

*ETHNICITY*
```{bash}
awk -F, '{print $14}' /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/ADMISSIONS.csv | sed -n '2,$p' | sort | uniq
```


-How many (unique) patients are Hispanic? (Hint: combine Linux comamnds `head`, `tail`, `awk`, `uniq`, `wc`, `sort` and so on using pipe.)
**Solution:**
```{bash echo=TRUE}
grep 'HISPANI*' /home/203bdata/mimic-iii/ADMISSIONS.csv | awk -F, ' {print $2}' | sort | uniq | wc -l
``` 
There are 1652 unique patients are Hispanic.

## Q3. More fun with shell

1. You and your friend just have finished reading *Pride and Prejudice* by Jane Austen. Among the four main characters in the book, Elizabeth, Jane, Lydia, and Darcy, your friend thinks that Darcy was the most mentioned. You, however, are certain it was Elizabeth. Obtain the full text of the novel from <https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1342/1342.txt> and save to your local folder. 
    ```{bash, eval=FALSE}
    curl http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/42671/pg42671.txt > pride_and_prejudice.txt
    ```
Do **not** put this text file `pride_and_prejudice.txt` in Git. Using a `for` loop, how would you tabulate the number of times each of the four characters is mentioned?

**Solution:**
```{bash}
for character in 'Elizabeth' 'Jane' 'Lydia' 'Darcy'
 do
   echo $character
   grep -o $character pride_and_prejudice.txt | wc -l
done
```

The number of times Elizabeth is mentioned is 634.

The number of times Jane is mentioned is 294.

The number of times Lydia is mentioned is 170.

The number of times Darcy is mentioned is 417.

0. What's the difference between the following two commands?
    ```{bash eval=FALSE}
    echo 'hello, world' > test1.txt
    ```
    and
    ```{bash eval=FALSE}
    echo 'hello, world' >> test2.txt
    head test2.txt
    ```
**Solution:**

The > command directs 'hello, world' to the file "test1.txt"

The >> command appends 'hello, world' to the file "test2.txt".

0. Using your favorite text editor (e.g., `vi`), type the following and save the file as `middle.sh`:
    ```{bash eval=FALSE}
    #!/bin/sh
    # Select lines from the middle of a file.
    # Usage: bash middle.sh filename end_line num_lines
    head -n "$2" "$1" | tail -n "$3"
    ```
**Solution:**   Use vi and save the file as `middle.sh`

Using `chmod` make the file executable by the owner,  
**Solutuion:**
```{bash}
chmod u+x middle.sh 
```
and run
```{bash echo=TRUE}
./middle.sh pride_and_prejudice.txt 20 5
    ```

Explain the output. Explain the meaning of `"$1"`, `"$2"`, and `"$3"` in this shell script. Why do we need the first line of the shell script?

**Solution:**
The output is the last 5 lines of the first 20 lines of pride_and_prejudice.txt.


`"$1"` is the first commandline argument. In this command, $1 is pride_and_prejudice.txt.


`"$2"` is the second commandline argument. In this command, $2 is 20.


Thus, `head -n "$2" "$1"` means print the first 20 lines of the file pride_and_prejudice.txt.


`"$3"` is the third commandline argument. In this command, $3 is 5.


Thus `head -n "$2" "$1" | tail -n "$3"` means print the last 5 line of the first 20 lines of pride_and_prejudice.txt.


We need the first line to specify this script uses /bin/sh to execute.



## Q4. R Batch Run

In class we discussed using R to organize simulation studies. 

1. Expand the [`runSim.R`](https://ucla-biostat203b-2020winter.github.io/slides/02-linux/runSim.R) script to include arguments `seed` (random seed), `n` (sample size), `dist` (distribution) and `rep` (number of simulation replicates). When `dist="gaussian"`, generate data from standard normal; when `dist="t1"`, generate data from t-distribution with degree of freedom 1 (same as Cauchy distribution); when `dist="t5"`, generate data from t-distribution with degree of freedom 5. Calling `runSim.R` will (1) set random seed according to argument `seed`, (2) generate data according to argument `dist`, (3) compute the primed-indexed average estimator and the classical sample average estimator for each simulation replicate, (4) report the average mean squared error (MSE)
$$
  \frac{\sum_{r=1}^{\text{rep}} (\widehat \mu_r - \mu_{\text{true}})^2}{\text{rep}}
$$
for both methods.

**Solution:**
This is my 'runSim.R' code: Run with rep=50, seed=203, n=100, dist='gaussian'
```{r}
## parsing command arguments
for (arg in commandArgs(TRUE)) {
  eval(parse(text=arg))
}
rep <- 50
seed <- 203
n <- 100
dist <- 'gaussian'
## check if a given integer is prime
isPrime = function(n) {
  if (n <= 3) {
    return (TRUE)
  }
  if (any((n %% 2:floor(sqrt(n))) == 0)) {
    return (FALSE)
  }
  return (TRUE)
}

## estimate mean only using observation with prime indices
estMeanPrimes = function (x) {
  n = length(x)
  ind = sapply(1:n, isPrime)
  return (mean(x[ind]))
}

#set seed for random number generation
set.seed(seed)
mseSampAvg = 0
msePrimeAvg = 0
for (r in 1:rep) {
  #parse the distribution information
  if (dist == "gaussian") {
    # simulate data
    x = rnorm(n)
  }else if (dist == "t1") {
    x = rt(n, df = 1)
  }else if (dist == "t5") {
    x = rt(n, df = 5)
  }else{
    stop("unrecognized distribution")
  }
  #try two methods
  mseSampAvg = mseSampAvg + mean(x)^2
  msePrimeAvg = msePrimeAvg + estMeanPrimes(x)^2
}
MSE<-c(mseSampAvg / rep, msePrimeAvg / rep)
MSE

```
In shell:
```{bash}
Rscript runSim.R  n=100 dist=\"gaussian\" seed=203 rep=50
```


2. Modify the [`autoSim.R`](https://ucla-biostat203b-2020winter.github.io/slides/02-linux/autoSim.R) script to run simulations with combinations of sample sizes `nVals = seq(100, 500, by=100)` and distributions `distTypes = c("gaussian", "t1", "t5")` and write output to appropriately named files. Use `rep = 50`, and `seed = 203`. 

**Solution:** This is my `autoSim.R` code:
```{r echo=TRUE}
#autoSim.R
rep <- 50
seed <- 203
distTypes = c("gaussian", "t5", "t1")
nVals <- seq(100, 500, by=100)
for (n in nVals){
  for (dist in distTypes){
    oFile <- paste("n", n, dist, ".txt", sep="")
    arg <- paste(" n=", n, " dist=", shQuote(shQuote(dist)), " seed=", seed," rep=", rep, sep="")
    sysCall <- paste("nohup Rscript runSim.R", arg, " > ", oFile, sep="")
    system(sysCall,wait = FALSE)
    print(paste("sysCall=", sysCall, sep=""))
  }
}
```
In shell:
```{bash}
Rscript autoSim.R
```


3. Write an R script to collect simulation results from output files and print average MSEs in a table of format

| $n$ | Method   | Gaussian | $t_5$ | $t_1$ |
|-----|----------|-------|-------|----------|
| 100 | PrimeAvg |       |       |          |
| 100 | SampAvg  |       |       |          |
| 200 | PrimeAvg |       |       |          |
| 200 | SampAvg  |       |       |          |
| 300 | PrimeAvg |       |       |          |
| 300 | SampAvg  |       |       |          |
| 400 | PrimeAvg |       |       |          |
| 400 | SampAvg  |       |       |          |
| 500 | PrimeAvg |       |       |          |
| 500 | SampAvg  |       |       |          |

**Solution:**
```{r}
col1 <- c()
col2 <- c()
for (n in seq(100, 500, by=100)) {
  col1 <- append(col1, c(n, n))
  col2 <- append(col2, c("PrimeAvg", "SampAvg"))
}
#create an empty table
table <- data.frame(
  n = col1,
  Method = col2,
  Gaussian = NA, 
  t5 = NA, t1 = NA
           )
#write the data into table
distTypes = c("gaussian","t5", "t1")
nVals = seq(100, 500, by=100)
i <- 0
j <- 0
for (n in nVals) {
  i <- i + 1
  j <- 0
  for (dist in distTypes) {
    j <- j + 1
    File = paste("n", n, dist, ".txt", sep="")
    t <- read.table(File)
    table[2 * i-1, j + 2] <- t[1, 3]
    table[2 * i, j + 2] <- t[1, 2]
  }
}
library ( knitr )
kable (table, format = "markdown", align = 'c' )
